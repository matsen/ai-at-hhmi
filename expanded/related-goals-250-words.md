DASMs are a novel framework, and we are not aware of any analogous efforts.

The closest effort is from our collaborator Yun Song, who is developing deep protein evolution models. These don't separate out mutation and selection, and so do not have the advantages for functional prediction described here.

The EvolutionaryScale startup company, which develops the ESM class of protein language models, is in a sense a competitor.
They use masked language modeling as does the rest of the community, and I suspect their models would perform better on functional tasks if they used a DASM-like framework.
