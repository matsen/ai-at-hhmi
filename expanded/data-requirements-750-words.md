The antibody sequences, viral sequences, and sequences for general proteins are all available in public data sets or data shared by collaborators.  There is no need for additional sequencing.

That said, our comprehensive tree and ancestral sequence reconstruction will create new "data" that we will share with the community.  We are inspired by the curated Observed Antibody Space database from Charlotte Deane's group and will follow their model.

It may be interesting to generate a few additional deep mutational scanning datasets for training or validation.
