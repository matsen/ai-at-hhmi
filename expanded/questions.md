vision-500-words.txt
Vision Statement (~500 words)
Describe proximal goals of the project, including concrete and/or intellectual deliverables. These should be specific and completable.

time-250-words.txt
Time (~250 words)
Explain and justify approximately how much time would be required to achieve these goals.

examples-500-words.txt
Specific Examples (~500 words)
Provide some specific examples of what could be achievable in the future (e.g., in academia, industry, clinics, society) if the proposed work is completely successful. These scenarios don’t need to be highly probable, but they should at least be plausible and should not be possible without your work. In other words, in what ways might your proposed project pass the "subtraction test” in the future?

related-goals-250-words.txt
Related Goals (~250 words)
Discuss other efforts to achieve similar or related goals in academia and industry and how your project competes with or complements these efforts.

data-requirements-750-words.txt
DATA AND EXPERIMENTS
Data Requirements (~750 words)
How much of the data needed is already available (in your lab and elsewhere)? If additional data are required:

* How much more data does the project require?

* How have you estimated that requirement?


experimental-design-750-words.txt
Experimental Design (~750 words)
Describe the assay or other experimental procedures that will be used for data collection.

* What is your estimate of the rate of data collection?

* How many people (engineers, experimentalists, technicians, etc.) and what kinds of special expertise are needed to build and run a high-throughput pipeline?

* What special equipment (including robotics) or reagents are needed?

* With these resources, what is the estimated duration for completion of all data collection?

personnel-300-words.txt
Personnel (~300 words)
Assuming the data is available, or will become available, what special expertise is needed to curate the data and use it to build AI models and tools? How many AI Scientists, AI Engineers, and Data Engineers are needed for the project (full-time equivalents)?

resources-300-words.txt
Resources (~300 words)
What are the computational needs of the project (GPU, CPU, storage, specialized hardware and software)?

risks-200-words.txt
RISKS
(~200 words)
What are possible risks or barriers to completion of the project, and at what stage will they be detectable? These could include experimental, computational, or conceptual challenges.
