Immune selection changes over time: can we ingest that?
Andrea's project: neutralization assay with 100 viruses at a time: which is most resistant.
John is interpolating that across the tree.

With SARS2, not enough data anymore for the Bloom-Neher pipeline. 
Could we extend into that low-data regime?





Everything that ESM can do but better and faster, and in the framework of natural selection. Variant effect prediction for point mutations and indels. Laying groundwork for structural prediction.
