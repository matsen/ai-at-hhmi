Yun (who is going to be collaborating) is doing deep protein evolution models. These don't separate out mutation and selection.

I don't think that there are any deep selection models out there.

EvolutionaryScale is a huge competitor, but they use using masked language modeling like everyone.
This would complement their aims, which use multimodal training with structures, I think.
